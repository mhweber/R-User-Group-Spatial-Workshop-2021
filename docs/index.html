</div>
<p>Why use R for spatial analysis?</p>
<ul>
<li>R is lightweight, free, open-source and cross-platform</li>
<li>Works with contributed packages - currently 18,188 - extensibility</li>
<li>Automation and recording of workflow (reproducibility)</li>
<li>Optimized work flow - data manipulation, analysis and visualization all in one place</li>
<li>R does not alter underlying data - manipulation and visualization in memory</li>
<li>R is great for repetetive graphics</li>
<li>R is great for integrating different aspects of analysis - spatial and statistical analysis in one environment</li>
<li>Leverage statistical power of R (i.e. modeling spatial data, data visualization, statistical exploration)</li>
<li>Can handle vector and raster data, as well as work with spatial databases and pretty much any data format spatial data comes in</li>
<li>R’s GIS capabilities growing rapidly right now - new packages added monthly - currently about 275 spatial packages (depending on how you categorize)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some drawbacks to using R for GIS work</p>
<ul>
<li>R not as good for interactive use as desktop GIS applications like ArcGIS or QGIS (i.e. editing features, panning, zooming, and analysis on selected subsets of features)</li>
<li>Explicit coordinate system handling by the user, no on-the-fly projection support</li>
<li>In memory analysis does not scale well with large GIS vector and tabular data</li>
<li>Steep learning curve</li>
<li>Up to you to find packages to do what you need - help not always great</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.6.0.1</span> <strong>Terminology: data structures</strong></h4>
<p>R is an interpreted language (access through a command-line interpreter) with a number of data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames, lists) and extensible objects (regression models, time-series, geospatial coordinates) and supports procedural programming with functions.</p>
<p>To learn about objects, become friends with the built-in <code>class</code> and <code>str</code> functions. Let’s explore a new dataset - <a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins">palmerpenguins</a> - recently developed by Allison Horst as an alternative to the old R standby <code>iris</code> dataset:</p>

<p><code>penguins</code> is a <a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/">tibble</a>, which is a new <code>tidyverse</code> spin on <code>data frames</code>, and was created as a new alternative to the <code>iris</code> data set that has been used extensively for beginning tutorials on learning R. Data frames consist of rows of observations on columns of values for variables of interest - they are one of the fundamental and most important data structures in R. <code>tibbles</code> make a few improvements / changes to <code>data frames</code> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never converting strings to factors</li>
<li>Never creating row names</li>
<li>Updated print method that only shows first 10 rows, just the columns that fit on the screen, and the type of each column (just as we get using <code>str</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can easily convert objects from <code>tibble</code> to <code>data frame</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="index.html#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tibble)</span>

<p>But as we see in the result of <code>str(penguins)</code> above, following the information that <code>penguins</code> is a <code>tibble</code> with 344 observations of 8 variables, we get information on each of the variables, in this case that 2 are numeric, 2 are integers, and 3 are factors - factors encode categorical variables - and <code>str</code> gives us the number of levels in each factor.</p>
<p>First off, R has several main data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>logical</li>
<li>integer</li>
<li>double</li>
<li>complex</li>
<li>character</li>
<li>raw</li>
<li>list</li>
<li>NULL</li>
<li>closure (function)</li>
<li>special</li>
<li>builtin (basic functions and operators)</li>
<li>environment</li>
<li>S4 (some S4 objects)</li>
<li>others you won’t run into at user level</li>
</ul>
<p>We can ask what data type something is using <code>typeof</code>:</p>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;integer&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We see a couple interesting things here - <code>penguins</code>, which we just said is a <code>tibble</code>, is a data type of <code>list</code>. <code>bill_length_mm</code> is data type <code>double</code>, and in <code>str(penguins)</code> we saw it was numeric - that makes sense - but we see that <code>species</code> is data type <code>integer</code>, and in <code>str(penguins)</code> we were told this variable was a factor with three levels. What’s going on here?</p>
<p>First off, <code>class</code> refers to the abstract type of an object in R, whereas <code>typeof</code> or <code>mode</code> refer to how an object is stored in memory. So <code>penguins</code> is an object of class <code>tibble</code>, but it is stored in memory as a list (i.e. each column is an item in a list). Note that this allows tibbles and data frames to have columns of different classes, whereas a matrix needs to be all of the same mode.</p>
<p>For our <code>species</code> column, we see it’s <code>mode</code> is numeric, it’s <code>typeof</code> is <code>integer</code>, and it’s class is <code>factor</code>. Nominal variables in R are treated as a vector of integers 1:k, where k is the number of unique values of that nominal variable and a mapping of the character strings to these integer values.</p>
<p>This allows us to quickly see see all the unique values of a particular nominal variable or quickly re-asign a level of a nominal variable to a new value - remember, everything in R is in memory, so don’t worry about tweaking the data!</p>

<p>See if you can explain how that re-asignment we just did worked.</p>
<p>To access particular columns in a <code>tibble</code> or <code>data frame</code>, as we saw above, we use the <code>$</code> operator. We can see the value of <code>species</code> for each observation in <code>penguins</code> as well as listing of all levels of the variable by running:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Spatial Data in R</h2>
<p>We can represent spatial data as discrete locations (points, lines or polygons) or as a grid of values rendered on a map as pixels. We typically represent the former type of data (discrete locations) as <em>vector</em> data, with an associated geometry or shape, and some attributes with information about the locations. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>state boundaries with state name and population</li>
<li>rivers with their flow volume and names</li>
<li>polygons of watersheds with their names and associated landscape information</li>
</ul>
<p>We represent the latter type of data (a grid of values as pixels) with <em>rasters</em>. Rasters can be continous (i.e. elevation, precipitation, atmospheric deposition) or they can be categorical (i.e. land use, soil type) - they can also be image based rasters, and they can be single band or multi-band.</p>

<p>We will delve into working with each of these types of data in their own sections, but let’s go over how these spatial data types are handled in R briefly.</p>
<p>Basic data structures in R can represent spatial data - all we need is some vectors with location and attribute information - below we generate cites with population, add a polygon, and make a map with a legend - take a minute to run this code in your own R session and make sure you understand what each line is doing.</p>

<p>We can see in this toy example that numeric vectors can represent locations in R for simple mapping. Points just need to be a pair of numbers in cartesian space, and lines and polygons are just a number of these points (note that polygons are closed by having their first point coincide with last point which the polygon function in base R graphics takes care of).</p>
<p>What about raster data? A raster in essence is simply a matrix of values for raster cells</p>

<p>We have a ‘raster’ of cell values in columnns and rows - but what is lacking?</p>
<p>You can do simple things with these spatial representations using basic R structures, but it breaks down quickly if you want to ask any spatial questions - for instance using the first example above, how would we figure out the nearest city to Corvallis? Or imagine the polygon is a county and we wanted to know what cities are within the county? Or how would we superimpose our cities on our raster cells? Or extract the value of a cell at the location of a city?</p>

<p><code>sp</code> was the core vector spatial data package in R for a number of years, and while still used and while many packages still depend on the package, we will focus entirely <code>sf</code> for working with vector data.</p>
<p>This portion of the workshop will focus primarily on the following core packages for working with spatial data in R:
- <code>sf</code> - The core package for working with vector data in R
- <code>terra</code> - The replacement package for <code>raster</code> which has been the primary spatial package for working with raster data in R
- <code>mapview</code> - this is a wrapper package for R <code>leaflet</code> package and I find simpler and more intuitive
- <code>ggolot</code> and <code>tmap</code> - static plotting and thematic maping
- <code>dplyr</code> - Not a spatial package, but <code>sf</code> is “tidy-compliant” and we will follow “tidy” workflows in this portion of the workshop for much or our examples</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html">R Spatial Task View page</a> provides current and comprehensive information on the ecosystem of R packages for working with spatial data - there are hundreds out there for specific tasks - we’ll touch on several others besides core packages above this morning.</p>
